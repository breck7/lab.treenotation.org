# Apply to join the Tree Notation Lab Internship Program

We're now accepting applications for the experimental first class of the 6-month Tree Notation Lab Internship Program. The program will officially begin in January 2020, but applicants will be accepted on a rolling basic and may be asked to get involved earlier.

This program is for people interested in helping build the Tree Notation ecosystem who have 0 to 10 years of experience. If you have more than 10 years of experience, you might be a candidate for the [lab](https://github.com/treenotation/lab.treenotation.org/blob/master/apply.md). The goal of this program is to:

1. Help people interested in technology in remote areas with little access to internship opportunities gain practical hands-on team experience making products.
2. Advance the goals of the Tree Notation Lab which are: 1) Improve cancer and medical research through better data science tools and electronic medical records; 2) Create a self-sustaining Tree Notation Ecosystem.

If you are interested in participating, send an email to [intern@treenotation.org](mailto:intern@treenotation.org) with answers to the following 3 questions:

1. What skillset are you looking to develop?
2. What do you hope to get out of being a member of the Tree Notation Lab Internship Program?
3. Provide your Gmail address, GitHub username, LinkedIn url, Twitter username, homepage url, blog url and Reddit username. Your accounts can be brand new, we just want to make sure you can get stuff done and learn how to use the tools the rest of the team uses.

## FAQ

### How long is the program?

6 months. Begins in January 2020 and ends in June 2020.

### Will I be paid?

No. This is a volunteer program.

### What are the benefits?

- You will meet other interns who could potentially end up being lifelong collaborators, cofounders, or friends.
- You will receive some feedback and mentorship to help guide you in your technical skill development.
- You will be contributing to the goals of the Tree Notation Lab.
- You will be able to put this experience on your resume if you successfully graduate which may turn out to be a good signal for future employers that you are a strong candidate.

### How much experience do I need?

No experience is needed.

### Do I need to be in Hawaii?

No. This is a remote program. All meetings and work are done remotely.

### What is the minimum time commitment?

You will assign yourself tasks within your abilities from our GitHub issues that you are expected to complete. You are expected to close 1 issue per month. In addition, your attendance is required in an internship group video conference once per month and a one paragraph monthly report is due each month.

We understand life happens, so you are allowed to miss up to 2 months. You'll need to complete 4/6 months to graduate from the program.

### Do I need to know English?

That would probably make things easier, but if you are able to figure out a way to cooperate effectively with the other interns via some type of translation setup, we would be open to trying it.

### Can I use ideas or code from the Tree Notation Lab for my future school projects, jobs, or in my private projects?

Of course. Most things we do are open and put into the public domain (currently under the MIT license). But, like everyone else, you are free to use the outputs of the lab however you wish. Zaldrizes buzdari iksos daor.

### What will my tasks be?

Take a look at the [Tree Notation Issues page](https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/issues) to see the types of tasks we need help with. Of course, you are also welcome to open your own issues on things you would like to improve in the Tree Notation ecosystem.

### When will the first meeting take place?

January 2020.

### Why are we doing this?

First, we expect that these interns will make significant positive impact in growing the Tree Notation ecosystem and may have more time to do certain tasks than the volunteers in our main lab. We believe that people with little or zero experience are often extremely passionate and talented, and the reason they have zero experience is more to do with not living near the right opportunities and mentors.

Second, some of the members of the Tree Notation Lab grew up far from the centers of technology and had little-to-no access to internship opportunities, and were lucky enough to eventually stumble upon good mentors, and this is a small way we can return the favor.

### Is everyone accepted?

No. We need to keep sizes small in the beginning in order to learn how to scale this in an effective and fun manner.

### How old do I need to be to apply?

You'll probably want to be at least a high graduate before applying but there are no age requirements as long as you meet the legal elgibility requirements, if any, in your local area.
