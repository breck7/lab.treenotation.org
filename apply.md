# Apply to join the Tree Notation Lab

The Tree Notation Lab is forming. The plan is to grow a volunteer organization to:

1. Help improve cancer and medical research through better data science tools and better electronic medical records.
2. Grow the Tree Notation ecosystem so it is self-sustaining.

Once we've done 1 and 2 dissolve the lab and go for a surf.

If you are interested in taking an active or semi-active role please send an email to [lab@treenotation.org](mailto:lab@treenotation.org) with answers to the following 3 questions:

1. What is the thing(s) you hate most about Tree Notation that you want to help improve?
2. What do you hope to get out of being part of the Tree Notation Lab?
3. How can we make a fun organization?

## FAQ

### What is the minimum time commitment?

One meeting per month. You can attend remotely.

### Are members paid?

No. This is a volunteer lab.

### Do I need to be in Hawaii?

No. We are based in Hawaii but this is a distributed research lab.

### Are there any perks at all?

Not really. There will be some free coffees, free meals, and perhaps some free trips to Hawaii.

### Do I need to know anything about biology or cancer research?

No. If you have a software background and help improve Tree Notation tools, you will be helping cancer research.

### Is everyone accepted?

No. To avoid wasting people's time due to bad organization, we want to grow slowly, adding the right people at the right time, and scale as our organizational capabilities improve.

### Can I use ideas or code from the Tree Notation lab at my company, startup or private projects?

Of course. Most things we do are open and made public domain (currently under the MIT license). But you are free to use the ideas from the lab in any way you wish. Zaldrizes buzdari iksos daor.

Besides participating in the discussions you would be doing what you are best at, which might be any of the following:

2. Implementing new Tree libraries in your favorite language(s).
3. Helping build meta test suites and documentation to be used by Tree Notation library authors.
4. Designing and building new Tree Languages.
5. Designing and building new applications that use Tree Languages.
6. Growing the community through blog posts, reddit modding, Twitter, conferences, writing papers, meetups, etc.
7. Starting companies that utilize Tree Notation.

### When is the first meeting?

Hopefully Q4 2019.
